# Shapes
Characteristics of shapes

Requirements 
1.	Define a Shape object, where the object is any two-dimensional figure, and has the following characteristics: a name, perimeter, and a surface area. 
2.	Define a Circle object which retains the characteristics of a Shape. The calculations for a circle are: 
a.	Area of circle = Pi*R*R where R=Radius, Pi=3.14 
b.	Perimeter (circumference) of circle = 2*Pi*R where R=Radius, Pi=3.14 
3.	Define a Triangle object which retains the characteristics of a Shape. The name of the triangle should consider if it is equilateral (all 3 sides are the same length), isosceles (only 2 sides are the same length) or scalene (no 2 sides are the same). 
a.	Area of triangle = (Height * base) / 2 
b.	Perimeter of triangle = a + b +c 
4.	Define 2 different quadrilaterals, a Square and Rectangle which retains the characteristics of a Shape. The name should consider if all sides are the same length. 
a.	Area of Square/Rectangle = width*length 
b.	Perimeter of Square/Rectangle = (width + length) * 2 
5.	We want to be able to sort a collection of Shapes by Area or Perimeter. Define methods/classes/interfaces that support this scenario and provide an example in Main.
6.	We want to be able serialize/store shapes in various formats on disk. Define methods/classes/etc that support this scenario and provide an example in Main (XML/JSON/Binary/etc pick one)
7.	We want to be able track (in-memory) the number of Shape objects created (per class) Define methods/classes/etc that support this scenario and provide an example in Main.
8.	Demonstrate understanding of Solid principles and design patterns.
9.	Demonstrate understanding of testing frameworks for writing unit tests.
